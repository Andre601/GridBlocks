# GridBlocks

![ia banner][banner]

GridBlocks is an ItemsAdder Add-on that implements blueprint-like looking blocks.  
The focus is to offer creators of add-ons and/or resource packs a way to see their creation at scale with some blocks. Think of it like the Placeholder Development Assets but for Minecraft.
