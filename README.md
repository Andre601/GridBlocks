# UtilityBlocks

![ia banner][banner]

UtilityBlocks is an ItemsAdder Add-on that implements blueprint-like looking blocks.  
The focus is to offer creators of add-ons and/or resource packs a way to see their creation at scale with some blocks. Think of it like the Placeholder Development Assets but for Minecraft.

## Download

- Download the `UtilityBlocks-<version>.zip` file from the latest release in the [Releases Tab][releases].
- Extract the `data` folder from the Zip.
- Upload the `data` folder to `/plugins/ItemsAdder/` on your server.
- Run `/iazip` to refresh the resource pack.
  - Remember to update the download URL if you're not using `self-host` or `auto-external-host`
